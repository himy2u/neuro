  <h1>Future Contribution to U.S. Healthcare</h1>
  <p style="color: var(--color-text-muted); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 40px; max-width: 600px;">
    Addressing critical national medical gaps through specialized expertise in complex neurosurgical pathologies.

    <h2>Statement of Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The United States medical community faces a continuous need for highly specialized surgeons capable of managing rare and complex neurological conditions, particularly in pediatric populations. My work focuses on filling exactly this gap—bringing specialized surgical expertise in treating refractory pediatric epilepsy and neurocutaneous syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      By integrating an international perspective into leading U.S. medical institutions, my objective is to not only perform life-saving operative procedures but also to drive forward clinical research, elevate standards of care, and improve outcomes for some of the most vulnerable patient demographics nationwide.
